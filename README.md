# SMART-IRRIGATION-SYSTEM

##PROBLEM
Several studies and surveys have shown that the performance of irrigation practices and equipment, especially in the uniformity of water application  ,is still too low .This is due to farmers lacking the management skills to manage their irrigation systems properly due to which  consequences result in reductions in crop yield and a waste of water resources .

##SOLUTION
To improve the irrigation performance ,it is necessary not only to promote the implementation of irrigation scheduling methods but concurrently improve system designs and enhance farmers skills to control and manage their irrigation system more efficiently during its operation. 
Thus ,The smart irrigation system is an IOT based device which is capable of automating the irrigation process by analyzing the moisture of soil and the climatic condition (like raining).
Also the farmer wouldn’t have to go again and again to fields and even control the irrigation of fields if he out of town or so by webpage linked to the microcontroller.
Hence ,Access to this modern technology could act as a boost to productivity and farming technology
